----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5
- [X] Phase 6

I discussed this assignment with:
- peers on Discord

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to use templates and urls. At the beginning 
of the assignment, I had struggled to piece together how each component of the MVC structure would interact. 
However, by the end of the assignment, I now see how to use HTML and connect it to a server based backend
using Django. It is very useful to know how to adjust HTML templates to control the results shown on the
web page. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was probably getting the page to show the 'Not Due' piece of information
for the submissions page. It was weird to wrap my head around how to calculate if the assignment is current
versus in the future.
