[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was that making a cohesive functional website was fairly simple. I
didn't realize how it doesn't take that much time to get the structure down, and then continue making progress from there.

The hardest thing in this assignment was that most of the keywords were new. I had to look at the HTML documentation often
to check how to add something in, which was more of a hassle than a 'difficulty' persay. It was a little frustrating to not
be able to make the project look good and to only have the bare structure, but I do know we're adjusting this later.
