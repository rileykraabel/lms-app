----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:
1. peers on Discord

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to get the code to actually do things without running in a program. I had no idea that this was how 
JavaScript works, or how to do something like this until now. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting the sorting execution to work. I have no idea how it got messed up, but it did not sort on first click. It would
be one-off, and I had a lot of trouble getting this to work. Same with the final grade calculation because it contained information from the last week's assignment, 
which I had trouble getting to work.
