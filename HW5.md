Homework 5 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5

I discussed this assignment with:
Peers who posted on the class Discord. 

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to handle file submissions. It took me a little while to understand where
the file path information was coming from and what was happening below, but once I understood it was very cool. I liked how the submissions
automatically download, even if that's simple and the only way it can be executed. Saves more time compared to opening the file through the browser. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting the grade calculator to function properly. I was unable to get it to account for missing assignments, which
was quite frustrating. This comes because since the user hasn't created a submission, there is nothing to assign a score of 0 to, which I fought for a while.
I eventually gave up.
