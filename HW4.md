Homework 4 Cover Sheet
----------------------

In this assignment, I completed:

- [X] Phase 1
- [X] Phase 2
- [X] Phase 3
- [X] Phase 4
- [X] Phase 5

[X] I have checked that I did in fact update and push `DOMAIN.md`.

I discussed this assignment with:
- other peers that posted onto the class Discord server.

[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was how to actually get a webpage to run. I have been
curious about how to get something like this started, so it was rewarding to actually get to execute it
on my own, with my own domain and a hosting server platform. I had no idea what DNS was prior to this class, 
and this assignment really made me feel like I understood what was happening as I walked through the steps. 

The hardest thing in this assignment was getting the submissions form to work. While this didn't take me a very
long time to figure out, it did cause some tricks for me. I was also struggling a little bit with the 500/404 error code
pages, and which is supposed to occur when, if ever. Overall, just small technical things for this assignment were hard, 
but it felt manageable compared to other assignments.
